# SICP Exercises

This repository contains my solutions(might also include rants :)) to exercise to the much talked about SICP(Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) book.
Brian Harvey claims it is the best book every written on Computer Science so I was curious to know why.

Anyways, this repositories should be updated every weekend(if I am not feeling lazy) or on some cool afternoon.

My solutions are a bit rough and I am not aiming for perfection. If you want something that covers more edge cases, take a look at [http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions).

I am companying the book with [Brian Harvey's SICP Lectures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter) as recommended by (https://teachyourselfcs.com)[https://teachyourselfcs.com/].

Wish me luck!
