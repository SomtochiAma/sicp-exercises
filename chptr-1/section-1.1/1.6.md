```
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
```

The new-if tries to evaluate all the arguments before applying them to the procedure(remember applicative order) so it never returns because it tries to evaluate `sqrt-iter` which is recursive.
