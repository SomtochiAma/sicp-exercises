## Time complexity

You can try drawing the tree out on paper. Each call spawns two more calls. So if you try to calculate using the number of nodes in a binary tree you get (2 ^ N).

But the tree is kinda skewed. The depth of the left branch is never more than 5 and the depth of other branch is (5 + n). I see proof around the internet that the time complexity is equal to (O ^ N). But I am yet to fully understand it. I will update when I do [TBD]

## Space complexity
The space complexity is O(N)
