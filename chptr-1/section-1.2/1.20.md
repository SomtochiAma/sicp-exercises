## Euclid's Algorithm

```
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))
```

### Process generated for (gcd 206 40) - Normal order

```
(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 (remaimder 206 40))
(gcd (remaimder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
(gcd (remainder 40 (remaimder 206 40)) (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))
(gcd (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))) 
     (remainder (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) 
                (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))))
=> (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
=> (remainder 6 (remainder 40 6))
=> (remainder 6 4)
=> 2
```
18 `remainder` operations are performed (Counting each time the `if` statemt evaluates b, then finally when a is returned)

### Process generated for (gcd 206 40) - Applicative order

```
(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 (remaimder 206 40) => (gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 (remaimder 40 6) => (gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 (remaimder 6 4) => (gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 (remaimder 4 2) => (gcd 2 0)
(gcd 0 2)
0
```

5 `remainder` operations are performed
