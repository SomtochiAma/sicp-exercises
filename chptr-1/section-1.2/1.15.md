```
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine
12.15) is evaluated?

The procedure `p` is applied 5 times.

b. What is the order of growth in space and number of
steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated
by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

The order of growth in number of steps is equal to log3(n/0.1) which is equal to 0log(n).
```
Explanation:
The order of growth in the number of steps is equal to how many times you have to divide n by 3 before you
get 0.1.
Expressed mathematically,
0.1 = n/(3 ^ x)  [x is the number of steps]
Therefore x = log3(n/0/1)
Removing the constants, It is equivalent to log(n)
```

The order of growth of space is the same.
