## For the first procedure

```
(define (+ a b)
(if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

Process generated:

```
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

This shows that the process is recursive.

## For the second procedure

```
(define (+ a b)
(if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Process generated

```
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```

This shows that the process is iterative.
